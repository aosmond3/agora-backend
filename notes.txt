* Cursor vs Connection in python sqlite3: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318126/why-do-you-need-to-create-a-cursor-when-querying-a-sqlite-database
In particular, the answer by AXO is useful.

* Do I need to close a Cursor object after use? No because the python
the cursors destructor function (__del__) closes it, so it will be closed
when python garbage collection occurs. However, it's recommended to close
it when you're done using it so other programs using the database can
access the database since only one cursor is allowed at a time https://nitratine.net/blog/post/python-sqlite3-basics/#closing-a-cursor

* How to explicitly make transactions (since some operations like create table are auto committed): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49056545/transactions-of-an-sqlite3-connection-used-as-a-context-manager-are-not-atomic
^ data definition language statements do not start a transaction

* sqlite3.connect() doesn't really establish the connection; that is done when you request the cursor
